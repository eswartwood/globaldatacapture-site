Global Data Capture — Minimal Logo Pack
======================================

Files included:
- gdc-logo-mark-silver.png  (transparent PNG, 1536x1024)

Recommended usage for current holder site / cert checks:
- Use this PNG as the standalone mark.
- In your HTML/CSS, render the legal name as live text next to or below the mark:
    GLOBAL DATA CAPTURE, LLC
- Under that, use your statement line:
    Software & Systems Engineering

This keeps the artwork clean (no baked-in LLC) while still showing
the full legal name clearly for any human reviewer.
